# resolution_study
In this work, we characterize the accuracy with which simulations of a given resolution can model galaxy clustering statistics.  We focus on models in which galaxies are directly matched to resolved halos and subhalos in simulations, using the subhalo abundance matching approach.
We investigate different abundance matching proxies and a range of galaxy number densities.  We present a model which characterizes the missing pairs in the 3D two-point correlation function due to inadequate resolution. We use a suite of simulations to test these effects explicitly for mass resolutions ranging from $\sim 3 \times 10^8$ to $\sim 1 \times 10^{10} \Msunh$, in all cases by using a paired simulation with at least eight times higher resolution. We suggest that a rough rule of thumb for the necessary resolution may be achieved by assuring that the impact of these missing pairs does not dominate over the sample variance of the relevant sample.
We use this approach to calculate the required resolution for several current and future galaxy samples, including those from the SDSS, GAMA, BOSS, and DESI surveys.
